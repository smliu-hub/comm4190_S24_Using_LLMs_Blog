    "text": "Welcome to our journey into the fascinating world of Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on raising awareness about egg allergies in young children aged 0-3. In today’s digital age, social media platforms like Instagram serve as powerful tools for spreading important messages and educating the community about various health concerns. In this blog, we delve into our innovative approach of utilizing LLMs to prompt Instagram posts aimed at increasing awareness of egg allergies among parents and caregivers.\nOur research is centered around a unique 2x2 experiment designed to uncover the most effective types of prompts for Instagram posts. We explore the variables of narrative versus informative content, as well as positive versus negative tones. By systematically testing these different combinations, we aim to identify the most impactful strategies for engaging our audience and encouraging proactive measures to safeguard children with egg allergies.\nWe chose ChatGPT4.0 as the main model. The process begins with generating text for the Instagram posts using advanced LLM technology. These posts are crafted to convey important information about egg allergies in a manner that resonates with our target audience. Subsequently, we harness the descriptive capabilities of LLMs to create visually compelling poster pictures that complement the content of our posts.\nEach poster picture is accompanied by a title and slogan derived from the detailed descriptions provided by the LLMs. These titles and slogans serve as captivating hooks to draw viewers’ attention and communicate key messages about egg allergy awareness effectively.\nIn addition to the visually engaging posters, we also create informative posters containing textual information to supplement our Instagram posts. These informative posters aim to provide comprehensive details about egg allergies, including symptoms, management strategies, and prevention tips.\nFurthermore, we establish criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of Instagram posts in conveying the intended message and eliciting audience engagement. We enlist the assistance of LLMs to rate four sample posts based on these criteria, allowing us to refine our approach and maximize the impact of our awareness campaign.\nThrough this blog, we invite you to join us on our quest to harness the power of LLMs for promoting egg allergy awareness and ensuring the well-being of young children everywhere. Stay tuned for insights, updates, and discoveries as we navigate the dynamic intersection of technology, health advocacy, and social media outreach.\nflowchart LR\n  B[Post pictures] --&gt; C[Poster texts]\n  B --&gt;D[Poster]\n  C --&gt;D[Poster]\n  A[Post tests] --&gt;E[Ins post]\n  D --&gt;E[Ins post]\n  E --&gt;G[Rating]\n  F[Ins post Criteria] --&gt;G[Rating]\n::: :::"

    "text": "IP\nBased on the provided criteria, here’s the evaluation of the post:\nContent Quality (18/20): The post contains informative text addressing the importance of recognizing and managing egg allergies in children. However, since it’s described as an “informational graphic or poster,” there’s no mention of accompanying images or videos. Including high-resolution images or videos demonstrating relevant scenarios (like identifying egg-containing foods or administering an epinephrine auto-injector) could enhance content quality.\nRelevance (20/20): The content is highly relevant to the theme of the account, which focuses on parenting and child health. It addresses a common concern among parents and provides valuable information on managing egg allergies in children.\nCreativity (16/20): While the post effectively communicates important information, it lacks creativity in presentation. It follows a standard format of bullet points and informative text without incorporating unique or innovative elements that could make it stand out on social media platforms.\nEngagement (18/20): The post encourages engagement by providing practical tips and advice for parents dealing with egg allergies in their children. It prompts interaction by suggesting actions such as educating oneself, reading food labels, and carrying an epinephrine auto-injector. However, it could further enhance engagement by directly asking questions or encouraging users to share their experiences with managing food allergies in children.\nEmotional Connection (19/20): The post effectively appeals to the emotional aspect of parenting by addressing concerns about children’s health and well-being. It emphasizes the importance of being informed and proactive in managing egg allergies to ensure the safety and comfort of children. However, including personal anecdotes or testimonials from parents dealing with egg allergies could strengthen the emotional connection.\nOverall Score: 91/100\nExplanation: The post scores well in relevance, engagement, and emotional connection by addressing a pertinent topic for parents and providing practical advice.

The use of an illustrative image is a creative touch, but the content itself is straightforward and informational without much flair in terms of presentation or delivery.\nEngagement (18/20): The post encourages engagement indirectly by raising awareness about a critical issue that parents may want to discuss or share with others. It prompts parents to consider their child’s health and safety, which could lead to comments or shares among concerned parents.\nEmotional Connection (20/20): The post effectively taps into the emotions of parents by discussing the potentially life-threatening consequences of egg allergies in children. It emphasizes the importance of vigilance and early detection, which can resonate strongly with parents who prioritize their child’s well-being.\nOverall Grade: 95/100\nExplanation: This post scores highly across all criteria, providing valuable information that is both relevant and emotionally engaging for young mothers.
